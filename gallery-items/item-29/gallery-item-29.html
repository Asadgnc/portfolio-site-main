                        <p>
                            In the summer of 2025, I made one of the most abrupt and risky decisions of my life. I completely abandoned my preparation for the YKS (Turkish University Entrance Exam) and shifted my entire focus to the SAT. It felt like madness; I had only 3-4 months left before the application deadlines, and my English level was nowhere near advanced enough to tackle the dense reading passages. But I had made my choice.

                        <h3>16-Hour Days and Free Soup</h3>
                        <p>
                            My social life vanished instantly. The local municipal library became my new residence. Along with my close friend <strong>Emin Bozak</strong>, who was preparing for the YKS with equal ferocity, we established a grueling routine. We were the first to enter at 08:30 AM and the last to leave when the lights went out at 11:45 PM. The library became our home; we survived on the free soup, tea, and cookies provided to students. Breakfast, lunch, dinner—it all happened there.

                        <h3>Maçkolik Notifications and Basketball Breaks</h3>
                        <p>
                            Studying for 16 hours straight is mentally crushing. To survive, Emin and I created our own escape mechanisms. When our brains were fried, we'd take short, intense breaks: a game of Chess, a round of Okey-101 on our phones, or a quick basketball match outside. The funniest moments were when our favorite football team was playing. Unable to go to the stadium, we followed the scores on the "Maçkolik" app. There were times we forgot where we were and shouted in joy at a goal, earning us angry "Shhh!" sounds from the rest of the library. Those small moments of rebellion kept us sane.

                        <h3>The Strategy: 100 Words a Day</h3>
                        <p>
                            The biggest hurdle was the language barrier. I adopted a military-style discipline: I memorized <strong>100 new academic words every single day</strong>, forcing myself to use them in sentences. Half of my study time was just vocabulary drills. To conquer the Reading section, I read English novels for one hour daily. I solved every single practice question on the College Board website and completed all the BlueBook exams (though, in hindsight, the BlueBook felt slightly easier than the actual test).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Math section, however, was my sanctuary. My strong foundation came from my <strong>father</strong>, who had taught me the love and logic of mathematics when I was just 8 or 9 years old. His early mentorship was the reason I could breeze through the math while struggling with the English.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            After three months of relentless focus, memory drills, and library coffee, I sat for the exam. The result: <strong>1400.</strong> Achieving this score as a non-native speaker in such a short window was my validation. It proved that with enough obsession—and a good study partner like Emin—limits are just suggestions.
