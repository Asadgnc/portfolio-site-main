                        <h3>My Story</h3>
                        <p>
                            I’ve been fascinated by the mysteries of the universe since I was a kid. While many of my friends were playing games, I was reading about stars, black holes, and quantum mechanics, constantly asking "why" and "how." That curiosity led me to physics, where I discovered a world defined by patterns, logic, and endless questions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I soon realized that artificial intelligence shares that same sense of wonder—it's a tool for uncovering hidden structures, solving complex problems, and learning from data in ways that mirror the scientific method. My passion shifted from just understanding the universe to building the tools that can help us understand it.

                        <h3>Finding My Path</h3>
                        <p>
                            My academic journey has been about exploring this intersection of technology and human potential. I've dived into physics research, built AI projects, and, just as importantly, dedicated myself to mentoring other students.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Guiding learners through their own academic challenges—preparing for the SAT, TOEFL, or IELTS, reviewing application essays and CVs, and planning career paths—taught me a critical lesson: knowledge is most powerful when shared. True success isn't just about achieving a high score; it's about building the confidence and understanding that last a lifetime.

                        <p>
                            I combine my love for science and technology with a drive to make learning more intuitive and meaningful. I enjoy breaking down difficult concepts into simple insights, building effective learning strategies, and empowering students to achieve real results. My work is driven by curiosity, growth, and empowerment.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
                        <p>
                            Every project, research paper, and mentoring session is part of a bigger goal: to build a bridge between complex technology and the people who use it. I want to inspire curiosity, foster understanding, and help others realize their potential—because learning is a journey we take together, and I’m excited to share that journey with anyone willing to explore.
