        <h1>A Story Starting from the Middle</h1>
        <p>
          Why do we always assume a story must begin at the beginning?
          Life doesn''t unfold in straight lines, and I''ve never felt obligated to pretend mine does.
          So instead of opening with a perfect introduction, I prefer to start in the middlebecause that''s where things actually started making sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking back at high school, those years weren''t wasted. I simply hadn''t figured out what this powerful "machine" inside my head was meant to build. It was like owning a multi-functional device and using it only to check the time. The device wasn''t the problem; the direction was. And once I found that directionsomewhere in the middle of the roadeverything clicked. It wasn''t stupidity; just a late software update.

        <h2>Thinking and Mental Laboratory</h2>
        <p>
          "When does real thinking begin?"
          There is no universal answer. One day I caught myself solving three separate problems at once and wondered, "Is this normal?"
          But then againwhy do we care so much about being normal?
        </p>
        <p>
          My curiosity eventually drifted toward artificial intelligence. Not because I wanted to study it academically, but because of a contradiction that bothered me:
          If AI systems are modeled after the human brain, how can machines outperform us in certain tasks?
          Maybe the issue isn''t raw capacity but how we use that capacity. Maybe the brain is a vast city, and most people only use three stations while the rest remain dark.
        </p>
        <p>
          So instead of "improving" my brain, I decided to <strong>wake it up</strong>.
          I treated myself like a small laboratoryevery decision a test, every result a reaction. I trained myself to solve multiple problems at once, sped up mental calculations, tried to perform the steps of an integral in my mind. I didn''t become a superhero, but something in my cognitive reflexes changed.

        <h2>Social Me, Silent Me, and the In-Between Me</h2>
        <p>
          In high school, I was social. But as I started thinking more deeply, I noticed that many conversations looped in circles. It wasn''t badjust slower than my rhythm. So I stepped back for a while, then realized that was another extreme.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I live between the two: on stage when needed, in my mental lab when needed. The sum of the two makes me who I am.

        <h2>A Gallery Full of Experiments</h2>
        <p>
          The activities in my gallery aren''t just "achievements."
          They''re answers to the question:
          "What did I wonder about, and what did I try?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Variety isn''t something I show offit''s simply how my mind works. Each activity is another <strong>small experiment</strong>. Moving between cultural, social and personal projects alongside academic responsibilities reminds me that my mind isn''t single-roomed.

          My family isn''t a pressure; they''re a coordinate systemsomething stable to return to when recalibration is needed. As a kid, I learned to make them happy; as I grew, I learned to grow for myself and, hopefully, for the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I make my own decisions, and I use that freedom for a purpose. That purposefulness might be the trait I value most in myself: <strong>loyalty to purpose</strong>.

        <h2>Zeros, Ones and the Sky</h2>
        <p>
          In the short term, my path is clear: computer science and artificial intelligence. I love thinking with zeros and ones; there''s a philosophical depth within mathematical simplicity.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the long term, I see myself drifting toward physicsmaybe 20 or 30 years from now, exploring the sky from another angle. But today, I''m laying the foundation with zeros and ones. First the foundation, then the sky.

        </p>
        <p>
          But that''s the beauty of it: my curiosity is still very much alive. And where curiosity lives, a story never truly ends.
