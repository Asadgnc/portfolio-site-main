                <h1>High School Website: A Peer-to-Peer Academic Support Hub</h1>
                <p class="section-subtitle project-subtitle">
                    This project was one of my earliest ventures into web development, born from a desire to help fellow students. Developed with a friend, it was a direct response to a shared challenge: the lack of a single, organized platform for study materials.

                        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                        <p>
                            During my early high school years, my classmates and I faced a common frustration: study materials, exam information, and academic resources were completely decentralized. Students had to search fragmented sources or rely on word-of-mouth to find sample questions, making exam preparation inefficient and stressful. We lacked a single, reliable hub for academic support.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h2>My Solution</h2>
                        <p>As a response, a friend and I took the initiative to build the "High School Website." We developed a simple, centralized web platform designed specifically for our fellow students. The site served as a peer-to-peer resource center that organized and provided:</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Curated Exam Materials:</strong> We gathered and shared sample questions and key topic outlines for upcoming exams across all grades (9-12).</li>
                            <li><strong>School Analytics & Guides:</strong> We offered straightforward analyses and advice on navigating our school's curriculum and academic expectations.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>The platform successfully transformed a fragmented system into a single, accessible hub, making it easier for students to find the help they needed to succeed.</p>

                        <h3>My Takeaway</h3>
                        <p>While not a complex system by today's standards, this project was a critical first step. It taught me the fundamentals of project collaboration, user-focused design, and the immense value of taking initiative. It cemented my interest in building practical tools that solve real-world problems for a community.</p>
